# SELISE Assesment 

## Requirements:
There will be two Menu,
1. Authors
2. Favorite Authors

### Authors:
Authors menu should display the list of Authors. The list has pagination & the list item should be a reusable common component (Let's name it ListItemComponent).
The ListItemComponent should display [name, bio, link] of an author. It will also have an “Add favorite” & “Remove favorite” button.

I can click on the “Add favorite” button & it will add that author in my favorite list. Also “Remove favorite” button should be showing on its place so that I can also remove author from favorite list
(Use browser local storage to store favorite author data)

### Favorite Authors:
The Favorite Authors menu should display the list of my favorite authors using the
ListItemComponent. If I click the “Remove favorite” button from this menu, the author should be removed from this menu list as well.
